Bonjour Ethan, to run this follow the following steps:
1. Start up the Backend server:
     1. cd into the server folder
     2. activate the virtual environment
     3. then run python server.py
     4. the server should now be running
2. Start up frontend
     1. cd into frontend server
     2. run npm run dev
     3. frontend should now be running locally and can be accessed at produced link
3. Use the bot:
     1. Open the webpage (sorry that its not pretty!)
     2. click on start conversation and you're off!
     3. It currently opens the video call so that you have a visual confirmation that it's started mais in future I would update frontend to have just a simple pulsing logo and no video...
     4. The bot currently points to my calendar! So any appointments you make with it will appear in my google calendar fyi...
  
NOTE: This is very bare and only has the core functionality, as mentioned before I would like to improve many things with the frontend but also with the bot interraction given more time...
